# Runes Implementation Changelog

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to implement the runes feature in the League of Legends Helper extension. The primary goal was to fix issues with rune assets not loading correctly and enhance the visual styling of the rune cards.

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated Image Loading Strategy

The main issue was that rune images were not loading properly from the backend API. We addressed this by using the Riot Games Data Dragon CDN directly:

- Updated all image loading code in `runes.js` to use direct Data Dragon CDN URLs:
  ```javascript
  const runeIconUrl = rune.icon ? 
    `https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/${rune.icon}` : 
    `assets/runes/${rune.id}.png`;
  ```

- Added a robust fallback mechanism that tries different image sources in sequence:
  1. First attempt: Data Dragon CDN using the rune's `icon` property
  2. Fallback: Backend API endpoint
  3. Final fallback: Styled placeholder with the rune's initial

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Improved the `_handleRuneImageError` function to use a cascade of fallback options
- Added better visual placeholders when images fail to load
- Ensured existing placeholders are utilized when available

### 3. Improved Fallback Image Logic

- Enhanced the `_createFallbackRuneImage` function to:
  - Check for existing placeholders in the DOM
  - Show placeholders with style-specific colors
  - Handle both rune style paths and individual runes differently

### 4. Added Testing Tools

- Created `test_rune_images.js` to verify image loading from Data Dragon CDN
- Implemented `test_rune_images.html` as a test harness for rune image loading

### 5. Documentation

- Created `README_RUNES.md` with comprehensive documentation about:
  - Image loading strategy
  - Rune styles/paths
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Implementation notes

- Added `RUNES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file) to document the changes made
