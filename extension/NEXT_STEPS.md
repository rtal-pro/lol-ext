## Migration Path to React

If considering migration to React in the future:

1. Create React components that mirror the current module structure
2. Replace HTML templates with JSX components
3. Move state management to React's state or context system
4. Replace custom event system with React props and callbacks
5. Replace DOM manipulation with React's virtual DOM
6. Implement a build pipeline with webpack or vite
