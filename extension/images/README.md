# Extension Icons

## Placeholder Icons
The script `create_placeholder_icon.sh` requires ImageMagick to be installed. If you encounter errors running it, you can manually create icons or use a graphics tool to create them.

## Icon Requirements
The extension requires the following icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Design Guidelines
When creating final icons:
1. Use Hextech styling with gold borders on dark blue background
2. Make sure they are recognizable at small sizes
3. Use transparent backgrounds if appropriate
4. Consider using a League of Legends related symbol or the Hextech emblem
5. Ensure the design is consistent across all sizes
